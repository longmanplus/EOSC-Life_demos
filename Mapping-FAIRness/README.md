# A workflow demonstrating data FAIRness 
Here we provide a taverna workflow to demonstrate the FAIRness of data (mappings between SNOMED terms and ORDO terms) brought about by FAIR Data Point and the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM). This directory preserves the turtle file containing the mappings.
